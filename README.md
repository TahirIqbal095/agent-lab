# 🤖 AI Agents (in Python)

This repository demonstrates the implementation of intelligent agents using **pure Python**. The aim is to explore and understand the core concepts behind generative AI agents by building them from scratch, minimizing reliance on third-party libraries.

## 🛠️ Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TahirIqbal095/agent-lab.git
    cd agent-lab
    ```

2. **(Optional) Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (if not already installed):**
    ```bash
    pip install uv
    ```

4. **Install dependencies using uv:**
    ```bash
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
