# AI Agent Patterns

This directory contains implementations of effective AI agent patterns inspired by an article by Anthropic. 
- [Building Effective Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents)

The following patterns are demonstrated:

- **Prompt Chaining:** Structuring agent workflows as a sequence of prompts, where each step builds on the previous output.
- **Routing:** Dynamically directing tasks to specialized agents based on input or context.
- **Parallelization:** Running multiple agent tasks concurrently to improve efficiency and throughput.
- **Orchestrator-Workers:** Using a central orchestrator agent to coordinate multiple worker agents for complex tasks.

These patterns provide a foundation for building robust, scalable, and maintainable AI agents.
